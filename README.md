# IntroductionToRobotics
Welcome to the repository of the third year of university course "Introduction to Robotics". 
In this lab, I've explored the exciting world of robotics using Arduino and delve into the fundamentals of building, programming, and controlling robots. 
This repository serves as a central hub for all the resources, code, and documentation related to the lab.

# Folder structure
* Homeworks - there are homeworks done during the semester
* Hardware - there are photos and diagrams with the Arduino Hardware
* Labs - there is the code written during the labs

## Homework #2

#### Task
I've used a separate potentiometer to control each color of the RGB LED, which includes Red, Green, and Blue. To achieve this, I have to employ digital electronics. My approach involves reading the potentiometer's value using Arduino and subsequently writing a mapped value to the LED pins.

## Homework #3

#### Task
This assignment involves simulating a 3-floor elevator control system using
LEDs, buttons, and a buzzer with Arduino. At the end of this task, I've gained
experience in using button state change, implementing debouncing techniques,
and coordinating multiple components to represent real-world scenarios

## Homework #4

#### Task
I've used the joystick to control the position of
the segment and ”draw” on the display. The movement between segments
is natural, meaning they should jump from the current position
only to neighbors, but without passing through ”walls”.

## Homework #5

#### Task
Using the 4 digit 7 segment display and 3 buttons, I've implemented a stopwatch timer that counts in 10ths of a second and has a save lap functionality (similar to most basic stopwatch functionson most phones).

## Homework #6

#### Task
I've developed a ”Smart Environment Monitor and Logger” using Arduino.  This sys-tem will utilize various sensors to gather environmental data, log this data intoEEPROM, and provide both visual feedback via an RGB LED and user interac-tion through a Serial Menu.  The project focuses on integrating sensor readings,memory management, Serial Communication and the general objective of build-ing a menu.
