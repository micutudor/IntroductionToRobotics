# IntroductionToRobotics
Welcome to the repository of the third year of university course "Introduction to Robotics". 
In this lab, I've explored the exciting world of robotics using Arduino and delve into the fundamentals of building, programming, and controlling robots. 
This repository serves as a central hub for all the resources, code, and documentation related to the lab.

# Folder structure
* Homeworks - there are homeworks done during the semester
* Hardware - there are photos and diagrams with the Arduino Hardware
* Labs - there is the code written during the labs

## Homework #2

#### Task
I've used a separate potentiometer to control each color of the RGB LED, which includes Red, Green, and Blue. To achieve this, I have to employ digital electronics. My approach involves reading the potentiometer's value using Arduino and subsequently writing a mapped value to the LED pins.
