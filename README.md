Welcome to the repository of the third year of university course "Introduction to Robotics". 
In this lab, I've explored the exciting world of robotics using Arduino and delve into the fundamentals of building, programming, and controlling robots. 
This repository serves as a central hub for all the resources, code, and documentation related to the lab.
